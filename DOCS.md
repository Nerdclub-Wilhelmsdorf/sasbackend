### Introduction
"Schule als Staat" is a German school initiative where students emulate the operation of a state, complete with its own economy, legal system, and cultural events. This project is designed to equip students with hands-on experience of political, economic, and social processes. 

In an increasingly digital world (where tax fraud is a concern ðŸ¥²), we've decided to adapt and provide a comprehensive digital currency solution. Our software is open-source and freely available on GitHub. 

To facilitate interactions with the banking system, we offer a REST API that can be accessed via our mobile app or web interface. This documentation provides detailed information about the API, enabling the software to be utilized for other "Schule als Staat" projects.

### Authentication
The API is guarded by a Bearer Token system, this measure to ensure a simple access authorization, it is highly recommended to change the token in code to a secret password ensuring that only authorized clients may access a specific instance. The token needs to be provided in the header through the following:
``` Authorization : Bearer YOUR TOKEN ```
